# Html2PDF Webservice

This is a very simple webservice, that uses the amazing [OpenHTML2PDF](https://github.com/openhtmltopdf/openhtmltopdf) to convert HTML to PDF.

Currently there are two client implementations available:
- [Extension:PDFCreator](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:PDFCreator).
- [Extension:BlueSpiceUEModulePDF](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:BlueSpiceUEModulePDF)

## JAR file build
To build the JAR file, run:
```bash
mvn clean package
```

## Docker image
Build the docker image with:
```bash
docker build -t webservice-htmlpdf .
```

Run the container with:
```
docker run -p 8080:8080 webservice-htmlpdf
```
## Included Fonts and Licenses

This project includes the following open source fonts as replacements for the PDF base 14 fonts and
generic fallbacks:

## Manual testing
To test the service manually, run:
```bash
cd manual-testing
composer update
php test.php data/doc1/
```

## Liveness probing and version check
To check if the service is responsive one can execute a HTTP request against the `servlet.context-path` (default `/Html2PDF/v1/`)

Example:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/Html2PDF/v1/
```
will return somthing like:
```
{"msg":"Service is running","success":true,"version":"2.2.3"}
```

## Fonts and Multi-Script Support

Due to the focus on PDF/A compliance, every font in use must be embedded in the
PDF. We ensure this with three measures:

1. set a `font-family` on the `html` element with a list of fallback fonts
	(Nimbus Roman, Noto fonts) for many commonly used scripts

2. replace all occurences of `sans-serif`, `serif` and `monospace` in
	`font-family` CSS properties with `...-fallback`, and load the appropriate
	fonts with those names

3. append fallback fonts to all occurences of `font-family` in CSS and `<style>`
	elements

This enables us to provide support for a large range of characters. You might
still run into issues for one of the following reasons:

1. use a font that was not uploaded with the HTML file (or provided by the service)

2. set `font-family` to a generic name (`sans-serif`, `serif`, `monospace`) in
	other content, e.g., SVG files

3. use very recent Unicode code points, e.g., the newest emojis, that are not
	yet embedded in the font files

4. use scripts that are not part of our fallback stack, e.g., ancient scripts

To mitigate these problems you will need to provide your own fonts and carefully
craft your `font-family` CSS declarations, so that each glyph is found reliably.

## SVG Data Images

SVG images may embed other SVGs using `data:` URLs. A custom Batik data protocol
handler preserves the document URL when resolving fragment-only references such
as `<use xlink:href="#box"/>` inside those images. Both percent-encoded and base64
data URLs are supported. Scripts and HTTP/file resource requests from SVG remain
disabled.

When an SVG contains an image reference blocked by that policy, the service logs
the omission and renders the rest of the drawing with that sub-image left blank.
The original SVG is not modified. This also applies to images inside embedded
SVGs; unrelated rendering errors are not suppressed.

Embedded GIF images are decoded from streams using Java ImageIO, since Batik's
default GIF decoder cannot load data URLs. GIF87a and GIF89a are supported,
including transparency; animated GIFs contribute their first frame to the PDF.

## "bshtml2pdf" compatibility
The old "bshtml2pdf" service ran servlets on a Tomcat server and hat `/BShtml2PDF` as the base URL. This service runs standalone and therefore lacks the `/BShtml2PDF` base URL. The client implementation must be adjusted accordingly.

If that can not be done easily, one can start the service with the `server.servlet.context-path` parameter:

```bash
java -jar \
	-Dserver.servlet.context-path=/BShtml2PDF \
	htmlpdf-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

or using the Docker image:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e APP_PATH=/BShtml2PDF webservice-htmlpdf
```

## Error bundles
**Disabled by default**, because bundles contain customer content. Set `HTML2PDF_BUNDLE_DIR` to enable them.

If enabled and a render fails, or only succeeds after falling back to untagged (no PDF/UA) rendering, the service stores the complete input (HTML, CSS, images, ...) of that document as `<errorId>.zip`, together with a `manifest.txt` (versions, wikiId, documentToken, stack traces). No `debug` flag is needed. The error ID is returned in the `X-Html2PDF-Error-Id` response header and is logged together with the bundle path.

| Setting (system property / environment variable) | Default |
|---|---|
| `html2pdf.bundle.dir` / `HTML2PDF_BUNDLE_DIR` (unset or empty: disabled) | not set (disabled) |
| `html2pdf.bundle.retention-days` / `HTML2PDF_BUNDLE_RETENTION_DAYS` | `14` |
| `html2pdf.bundle.max-count` / `HTML2PDF_BUNDLE_MAX_COUNT` | `100` |

### Configuration by deployment type
The settings are read from system properties (`-D...`) or environment variables. The environment variable names are the ones in the table above.

**Running the `.jar` directly**
```bash
java -Dhtml2pdf.bundle.dir=/var/lib/html2pdf/bundles -jar html2pdf.jar
# or
HTML2PDF_BUNDLE_DIR=/var/lib/html2pdf/bundles java -jar html2pdf.jar
```
Without the setting, no bundles are written. The error ID is still returned and logged.

**Using the Docker image of this repository**
Set `HTML2PDF_BUNDLE_DIR` and mount a volume there, otherwise the bundles are lost when the container is removed:
```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e HTML2PDF_BUNDLE_DIR=/data/error-bundles -v /var/lib/html2pdf/bundles:/data/error-bundles webservice-htmlpdf
```

**Using the `.jar` inside another Docker image / service**
Set the variable and a volume yourself, otherwise no bundles are written (or they are lost with the container if you point the directory into it). Example `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
services:
  html2pdf:
    environment:
      HTML2PDF_BUNDLE_DIR: /data/error-bundles
      HTML2PDF_BUNDLE_RETENTION_DAYS: "14"
      HTML2PDF_BUNDLE_MAX_COUNT: "100"
    volumes:
      - ./html2pdf-bundles:/data/error-bundles
```
The directory must be writable by the user the service runs as. If a bundle cannot be written, the service logs the reason, still returns the error ID, and answers as usual.

### Retrieving a bundle
The error ID from the `X-Html2PDF-Error-Id` response header (or the log line `Error ID <id> ... bundle=<path>`) is the file name: `<bundle dir>/<errorId>.zip`. Copy it from the mounted directory, or from a running container with `docker cp <container>:/data/error-bundles/<errorId>.zip .`.

Bundles contain the original document content. Treat them as confidential.

## TODO
* Implement proper support for custom fonts (e.g. from inline CSS)
